# 🧩 Little Zip  
*A puzzle game built using the Jaseci Stack*

Little Zip is a grid-based puzzle game where players must draw a continuous path that connects numbered cells in sequential order while covering the entire grid.  
The project is built using the **Jaseci Stack**, and future improvements include **LLM-based automatic level generation** using AI.

## 🧠 System Overview
Little Zip is currently hardcoded with sample levels, but the next major upgrade is to integrate AI models using LLM calls to automatically generate creative, valid puzzle levels.

Planned additions include:
- LLM-powered level generation  
- Difficulty scaling using heuristics  
- User-drawn path detection  
- Exportable puzzles
